## Problem Statement
Create a classifier of images that would try to predict whether CT Images scanned
for diagnosing COVID-19 are positive or negative in nature.

## Description
In a real-world scenario, especially medical ones, it is considered essential that the
sensitive data of individuals be kept as private and personal as possible. In our
case, we consider a scenario wherein we are presented with images of CT scans
and are asked to label them as COVID-positive and COVID-negative. We implement differential privacy using PATE analysis and adding noise to the output of the teacher models using RNM (Report Noisy Max) Algortithm.
